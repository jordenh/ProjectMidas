Steps taken to set up driver development environment:
1. Download WDK 8.1 Update (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/hardware/gg454513)
2. Create a new UMDF project based on template (Search online -> UMDF)
3. Download VirtualBox image for Windows 7 -- to be used as test computer. (http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads)
4. Set up VM in VirtualBox by Importing Application (with file extracted after step 3)
5. Make sure to enable a serial port on the virtual box settings:
    5a. Use Port Mode "Host Pipe", and create a pipe with the form: "\\.\pipe\<name>" where <name> should
        be replaced with a custom name of your choosing. This path goes into the Port/File Path input box.
    Note: You may have to toy with which COM port on the VM to use in the VirtualBox settings, because some
    devices may already be using the IRQ/IO ports virtualbox wants to assign to the serial port. For me,
    COM4 worked, but there were conflicts with the others.
    Another Note: After you set this up, ensure that the COM port is visible in the device manager. If it
    isn't, you may have to go through the process of adding it (in the Device Manager click on Ports (COM & LPT), 
    go to Action -> Add Legacy hardware, then follow the steps to add a COM port and change the settings to match
    the baud rate and port number as specified in VirtualBox. It would be prudent to test that you can communicate
    between the host and guest after this step. You can do this by installing putty on the host and guest, and opening
    a serial connection. On the host, enter the Pipe name and a baud rate of 115200. On the guest, enter a baud rate of
    115200 and the COM port you chose. Ensure you can send data between them.
6. Download WDK 8.1 Update on VM
7. Run Test Target Setup executable in WDK installation directory (i.e. C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Remote\x64\WDK Test Target Setup x64-x64_en-us.msi)
8. Run cmd as an administrator and run the following commands:
    8a. "bcdedit /debug on"
    8b. "bcdedit /dbgsettings serial debugport:<n> baudrate:115200" where <n> should be replaced with the COM
        port specified when setting the VM serial port settings in step 5a.
9. Reboot the virtual machine
10. On the host computer, in Visual Studio, under Driver, select Test > Configure Computer
11. Click Add New Computer
12. Enter a name and then select Manually configure debuggers and do not provision
13. Select Serial as Connection Type, select Pipe and select Reconnect
14. Enter the same pipe path used in step 5a
